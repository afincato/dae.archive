About
-----

This repository was initialised with [git](https://git-scm.com/), a version control system that stores and logs different versions of a folder and its contents.

Every day at 02:05, an indexing [script](http://80.100.106.160/jbg/bin/index.sh) runs automatically, which creates and updates the metadata of all uploaded files. A file in our archive will typically have the following metadata: ID, name, path, author, extension, commit messages, and version.

If a file is an image or video, its metadata will also include the predominant colours, as well as a list of tags that describe the visual contents of the file, as read by TensorFlow's [image tagging script](https://www.tensorflow.org/), that is based on [this dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/overview).

If a folder contains a file named "index.html", web browsers will render and display that webpage instead of the contents of the folder it's in.

How to use
----------

To upload a file:

1. Navigate to [http://80.100.106.160/jbg/dae-app/](http://80.100.106.160/jbg/dae-app/).

You can choose to upload individual files to your repository like this, but if you wish to have more file-management functionalities, you might want to use a git client.

A git client is a third-party application that provides a graphic user interface to interact with git repositories.

Our git client of choice is SourceTree. It is simple to use, open source and compatible with most platforms. Find our use instructions [here](http://80.100.106.160/km/HowToUseSourceTree.md).
