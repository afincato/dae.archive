<div class="aboutText">
  <pre>Welcome to the digital archive of Design Academy Eindhoven. We are currently in our first testing phase.

All users can have their own repositories inside the archive.  
All users with a repository can upload anything they want.
All users own the contents of their respective repositories.
Right now, the archive is stored on a server inside <a href="http://80.100.106.160/jbg">jbg</a>'s house, in Amsterdam.

The archive is based on <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">git</a>, a version control system that stores and logs different versions of a folder and its contents.

Every day at 02:05, an <a href="http://80.100.106.160/jbg/bin/index.sh" target="_blank">indexing script</a> runs automatically, which creates and updates the metadata of all uploaded files. A file in our archive will typically have the following metadata: ID, name, path, author, extension, commit messages, and version.

If a file is an image or video, its metadata will also include the predominant colours, as well as a list of tags that describe the visual contents of the file, as read by TensorFlow's <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/" target="_blank">image tagging script</a>, that is based on <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/overview" target="_blank">this dataset</a>.

If a folder contains a file named "index.html", web browsers will render and display that webpage instead of the contents of the folder it's in.

The archive is extensible. Users are encouraged to design and develop tools and extensions of the archive by using its API. Some examples of this include jbg's <a href="http://80.100.106.160/jbg/color" target="_blank">colour picker</a> and km's <a href="http://80.100.106.160/km/fun%20with%20css/meta-info-travel-dae-app/" target="_blank">metadata navigator.</a></pre>
